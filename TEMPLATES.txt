These are the templates I normally use:

Gl 809   M0
Gl 699   M4

Others that may be useful:

Gl 411   M2
Gl 436   M3
Gl 83.1  M4.5, active (but still slowly rotating)
Gl 406   M6  if something late is needed (but usually Gl 699 works fine and
             has higher s/n)

For consistent velocities, use Nidever et al. 2002 to set VELOCITY= keyword.
